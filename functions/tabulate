# I often need to save receipts and add up the values.
# Saving them in a filename format of "{subject} {amount}.{extension}"
# makes it easy to add up the amounts based on a grep filter.
#
# In the future, I'd like to reformat this to output
# as a table, but I think that much complexity warrants
# something other than bash. I might do this someday.
#
# For now: tabulate "filename filter" outputs:
# The matches
# The number of matches
# The extracted values
# The number of extracted values (as a visual checksum)
# The sum total of the extracted values
